///@brief imports tessellated meshes as carve meshes
//Open tasks & TODOS:
//- check each face for the correct winding order (counter-clockwise for faces, clockwise for holes)
//- check if a face is degenerated (collapsed to a line or a point) and reject it if it is
//- check for crossing edges and reject faces if they contain some
//- check if voids overlap/cross each other and reject them if they do
//- improve run time of mergeHolesIntoPoly by using a spatial structure. Currently
//  uses a naive algorithm, which is probably good enough as most polys have few
//  vertices, and few holes with few vertices (each in the single digit range)
//- check closed parameter and use it to use a different addPolyhedron method

	///the boundary to be counter-clock-wise and the winding order of holes
	///to be clock-wise - the same order is used by carve internally. By
	///concatenating the indices and adding a back-edge index pair we basically
	///"cut" the polygon open and define the hole in a way carve recognises it.
	///
	///To find a suitable cutting edge, a naive nearest neighbour search is
	///done. This can be improved by using a spatial tree like kd-tree or
	///R-tree.
